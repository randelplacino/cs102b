**Python Project: Projectiles**

Description: The program requests initial starting conditions for a projectile,
including the initial velocity (m/s), the initial angle of departure (degrees),
and the height at which the object is thrown.

The program calculates the time of flight, and graphs the projectile's path,
minimizing the window required to prevent the graph from dipping too far below
y = 0 (ground).

The program takes in both whole number and decimal values, but eventually
rounds the values that it graphs to simplify the graphing process.
